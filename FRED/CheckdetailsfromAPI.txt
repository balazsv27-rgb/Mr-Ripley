You’ve described a multi-factor nonlinear system. The key question is:

How do we map those conceptual drivers into structured, queryable data from FRED?

We won’t guess. We’ll separate:

Verified facts
Logical mappings
Assumptions
Speculative extensions

And we’ll be strict about what FRED can and cannot give you.

First: A Hard Truth

FRED is a macroeconomic time-series database.
It does NOT provide:

Real-time geopolitical event feeds

Media sentiment

ETF flows in granular form (some proxies exist)

CFTC positioning directly from CFTC (but some series exist)

Narrative intensity metrics

So we need to translate your conceptual framework into measurable proxies.

Gold = f( measurable state variables )

We convert philosophy → variables → FRED series IDs.

MACROECONOMIC DRIVERS

Real Rates

Verified fact: FRED provides Treasury yields and inflation measures.

You can compute real rates as:

Real 10Y ≈ 10Y Treasury – expected inflation

Relevant FRED series (examples):

DGS10 (10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate)

DFII10 (10-Year TIPS Yield – already real yield)

CPIAUCSL (CPI)

T5YIE (5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate)

T10YIE (10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate)

Categorization strategy:

Group under:
MacroDriverType = "RealRates"

In your database:
driver_category = "Rates"
driver_subtype = "RealYield"

Inflation Expectations

Use:

T5YIE

T10YIE

CPIAUCSL (YoY computed internally)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "Inflation"

USD Strength

FRED provides dollar indices:

DTWEXBGS (Trade Weighted U.S. Dollar Index: Broad)

DTWEXM (Major Currencies)

DEXUSEU (USD/EUR)

DEXJPUS (JPY/USD)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "Currency"
Key driver = Broad USD index

Monetary Policy / Liquidity

FRED has:

FEDFUNDS (Effective Federal Funds Rate)

WALCL (Fed Balance Sheet Total Assets)

M2SL (M2 Money Supply)

RRPONTSYD (Reverse Repo Operations, if needed)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "Liquidity"

Balance sheet expansion proxy:
ΔWALCL

GEOPOLITICAL RISK

Verified fact:
FRED does NOT directly provide wars or sanctions data.

However, it DOES include some stress indices:

GEPUCURRENT (Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index)

VIXCLS (CBOE Volatility Index)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "RiskPerception"

For wars and sanctions you need external structured datasets (ACLED, GDELT, etc.). Not FRED.

FINANCIAL SYSTEM STRESS

FRED has strong coverage here:

STLFSI4 (St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index)

NFCI (Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index)

TEDRATE (TED Spread)

BAMLH0A0HYM2 (High Yield Spread)

BAA10YM (Corporate Spread)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "FinancialStress"

This is high-quality signal territory.

CENTRAL BANK BEHAVIOR

FRED includes:

IMF reserve data (gold reserves in some cases)

IFS series (varies by country)

Official gold holdings for some countries

But large-scale central bank gold buying flows may require World Gold Council data (not native to FRED).

Possible proxies:

Total Reserves (TRESEGVNM052N)

Gold Reserves (country-level series if available)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "ReserveBehavior"

Confidence: Medium (coverage inconsistent across countries).

MARKET STRUCTURE

FRED includes:

CFTC Commitment of Traders (for gold futures)

VIX (volatility proxy)

Some ETF-related macro data

Examples:

GOLDAMGBD228NLBM (London gold fix)

CFTC series for non-commercial net positions

However:
ETF inflows (GLD holdings) are not natively in FRED.

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "Positioning"

Coverage confidence: Medium.

PHYSICAL SUPPLY / DEMAND

FRED is weak here.

You may find:

Mining production indices

Industrial production for metals

But jewelry demand, recycling supply, etc. are NOT robustly in FRED.

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "Physical"

Confidence: Low using only FRED.

COMMODITY CORRELATIONS

FRED provides:

DCOILWTICO (WTI oil)

SLVPRUSD (Silver price)

PCOBREUSD (Copper)

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "CrossCommodity"

STRUCTURAL DRIVERS

Debt:

GFDEGDQ188S (Federal Debt to GDP)

Debt series for other countries

Demographics:
Limited in FRED, but some population and dependency ratio data exist.

Categorize:
MacroDriverType = "Structural"

EXTREME TAIL RISK

Not directly measurable via FRED.

Possible proxies:

CDS spreads (limited coverage)

Sovereign risk spreads

Financial stress index spikes

True regime shifts require historical classification logic, not raw series.

How To Implement Categorization Cleanly

Step 1: Build a Driver Taxonomy Table

Example structure:

driver_id
driver_name
macro_bucket
sub_bucket
fred_series_id
frequency
transformation_rule
weight_initial

Example:

"real_10y"
"10Y Real Yield"
"MacroRates"
"RealYield"
"DFII10"
"Daily"
"none"
0.20

Step 2: Build a Driver → Equation Mapping

Gold = Σ (weight_i * normalized_driver_i)

But not static weights — regime dependent.

Step 3: Normalize Each Driver

Use:

z-scores

rolling percentile

rate-of-change

Gold responds to expectation shifts, so first derivative matters more than level.

Important Systems Insight

Your equation is incomplete unless you incorporate:

Δ expectations

Markets price change, not level.

So in database terms:

For each driver:
store:

level

Δ1

Δ5

zscore_252

Now the intellectually honest part:

FRED can cover:

Real rates

Nominal rates

Inflation

USD

Financial stress

Liquidity

Debt

FRED cannot fully cover:

ETF flows

Narrative intensity

Social sentiment

Central bank gold purchases in granular form

Real-time geopolitical events

So your Layer 2 can be 70–80% built on FRED.

Layer 1 (events) and external datasets must fill the rest.

Confidence Level: High (for FRED coverage mapping)
Uncertainty: Medium regarding specific gold-related CFTC series naming consistency across contracts

What would increase confidence:

Your exact gold instrument (spot? futures front-month? GLD?)

Your intended time resolution (daily vs weekly macro alignment)

Whether you want revision-aware modeling

Now we’re at the interesting frontier.

You can either:

Build a deterministic macro dashboard.

Or build a regime-conditioned probabilistic engine.

The second one is far more intellectually honest — and much harder.
