  "conclusion": "The dataset covers most macroeconomic and risk-sentiment proxies required for gold driver analysis: real yields (DGS10, DFII10, T10YIE), monetary policy (FEDFUNDS, WALCL), USD (DTWEXBGS), inflation (PCEPI, CPILFESL), employment (PAYEMS, UNRATE), VIX, S&P 500, and economic policy uncertainty. Critical gaps: (1) Gold spot price is absent—mandatory for gold analysis and disqualifies a High score. (2) GDPC1/A191RL1 not present. (3) Central bank gold and ETF holdings are partial or unavailable. (4) Mining and jewelry demand are outside FRED’s scope. To reach High suitability: add GOLDAMGBD228NLBM (or equivalent), GDPC1, and A191RL1. Score: Medium (≈62% factors covered fully or partially; 8 full, 1 partial, 4 missing)."
