This is the strategic integration of the data stack into layers and milestones, aligned with:

Architecture v3.3 governance model 

architecture4.md

The three-vertical-layer structure 

architetcture2

Gold-first. Deterministic. Fail-closed.

🏗 FULL STRATEGIC INTEGRATION
🔵 LAYER 2 – TRUTH LAYER

(Macro + Market Data, versioned, point-in-time correct)

This is the backbone. No narratives here. Only numbers.

🎯 Core Driver Block (Mandatory for M0)
Data Series	Role
DFII10	Real yield state
DGS10	Nominal yield
T10YIE	Inflation expectation component
DFF	Policy regime
DTWEXBGS	USD pressure
Gold (XAUUSD / GC)	Primary asset state
What this enables:

Real Yield Regime

Inflation Regime

Policy Regime

USD Regime

Trend State

Volatility State

This is the first deterministic state machine.

🟡 Stress & Correlation Block (M1)
Data Series	Role
VIX	Equity stress
MOVE	Rate volatility stress
SP500	Risk proxy + correlation reference
What this enables:

StressIndex

CorrBreakIndex

DriftIndex (rolling beta shifts)

This is where the system becomes “world-state aware.”

🟢 Structural / Validation Block (M2)
Data Series	Role
CPI	Inflation confirmation
T5YIFR	Forward inflation regime
GLD holdings	Flow confirmation
Mining production	Structural overlay

These are not core trading drivers.
They validate regime stability.

🟣 LAYER 3 – DECISION LAYER

Layer 2 data → Feature Builder → Index Suite → RegimeGate → Supervisor → DecisionPacket 

architecture4.md

Now in milestone structure:

🥇 M0 – Deterministic Macro Engine

Data:
DFII10, DGS10, T10YIE, DFF, USD, Gold

Goal:

Regime labels

Trend labels

Volatility labels

Basic confidence / uncertainty skeleton

Output:
DecisionPacket (BUY / SELL / NOTHING — paper only)

By the end of M0:
✔ deterministic replay works
✔ version lock active
✔ fail-closed enforced

🥈 M1 – Stress & Drift-Aware Engine

Additional Data:
VIX, MOVE, SP500

New Components:

StressIndex (0–100)

DriftIndex

CorrBreakIndex

DataFreshnessPenalty

New Governance Behavior:
UnknownMode activation
Soft position shrink logic

By the end of M1:
✔ system does not only trade
✔ it can explicitly choose NOT to trade

That is survival-level maturity.

🥉 M2 – Calibration & Harness Phase

Full dataset active.

Requirements:

≥ 100 decision ticks

≥ 30 paper trades

Brier score calculation

Reliability curve

Regime breakdown

CVaR measurement

C_min and U_max thresholds can only be frozen here.

This is where the system stops being experimental.

🧠 LAYER 1 – OPTIONAL (Later Phase)

Narrative layer is penalty-only.

It:

cannot generate direction

cannot flip signals

can only increase uncertainty or trigger cooldown

Only introduced after M3 stability.

📍 STRATEGIC TIMELINE

Phase 1 – Pure Numerical Backbone
Only macro + gold.

Phase 2 – Stress & Correlation Break Detection
System becomes instability-aware.

Phase 3 – Calibration Freeze
Confidence and uncertainty thresholds locked.

Phase 4 – Execution Harness
Strict orchestration pipeline.

Phase 5 – Portfolio Extension (crypto later)

🎯 What this really is

You no longer have a data list.

You now have:

Macro state space
→ Feature space
→ Regime space
→ Governance space
→ Deterministic decision contract

This is engineered decision infrastructure.

The next logical step is not adding more data.

It is defining:

Lookback horizons

Normalization method

Regime threshold logic

Initial uncertainty formula

That is where concept becomes mathematics — and mathematics becomes survival.
